# Homebrew rules

## Death

Resurection from dead if not guarantee. We are going to follow the same rules as critical role.

## Long rest

Let's change long rest rule a little bit to make it a little bit more strategic.

Long rest is composed of multiple blocks of 4 hours.
Party can take as much as block as they want.
The time spend on long rest can have multiple effect on the storyline or attrac more ennemies.

Rules:
* Standing guard is not considered as rest.
* To gain the bonus of rest, a PC must rest at least 8h (4h for elves) every ~24h. 
This block can be splitted between the whole period. 
* If the player cannot cover it's minimum period, it will automatically gain one point of exhuastion.
* To recover spell slots, a PC must cover his required rest period consecutively.
