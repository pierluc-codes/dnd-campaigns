Death tyrant

Undead Nature. A death tyrant doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

LAIR ACTIONS

When fighting inside its lair, a death tyrant can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the death tyrant can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:

* An area that is a 50-foot cube within 120 feet of the tyrant is filled with spectral eyes and tentacles.

â€¢ Walls sprout spectral appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next.

ABILITY

* Negatif energy cone. Any creature in that area can't regain hit points. Any humanoid that dies there becomes a zombie.

* Creatures within 1 mile of the tyrant's lair sometimes feel as if they're being watched even when they aren't.

Eye rays:
* Paralyzing Ray.
The targeted creature must succeed on a Medium-Hard Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.

* Petrification Ray.
The targeted creature must make a Medium-Hard Dexterity saving throw. 
On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained.

* Disintegration Ray.
If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Medium-Hard Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (l0d8) force damage. 
If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.

* And more ability...
